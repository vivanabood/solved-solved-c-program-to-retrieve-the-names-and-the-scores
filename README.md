Store ten student names and their individual score in a text file such as Notepad. There will be one score per student. For example, a line in the file may look as such: Carole McKinney, 95

Write a C# program using Microsoft® Visual Studio® to retrieve the names and the scores. This program may be a console application or a Windows Forms application. No matter whether you choose to develop a Windows Forms application or a console application, be sure the interface is professional looking and intuitive to use for the novice end user.

Display the highest score and the average score of the class. Show to the user what is being read from the input file.

Hint: You might consider adding delimiters between the data values in the original text file to simplify retrieving and processing the data.

Notes: If you would like the file to include more data than 10 records, it is acceptable to do so, but you must have at least 10 records. In addition, you do not need to validate the input data – that is beyond the scope of the assignment at this point. For the highest score, if you would like, you can also report the student name who had it, but it is not required. Include identifying information in the form of block comments at the top of each class in the project (programmer name, date, program description).

Include adequate comments throughout the program, utilize meaningful names for controls, variables, fields, and forms. Include white space for readability purposes in the code. Refer to the Programming Assignment grading form to view grading criteria.
